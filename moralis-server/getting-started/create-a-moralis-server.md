  Each dApp has an on-chain part (smart contracts) and an off-chain part
  (server). The server is used in order to collect data from the blockchain and
  serve it to clients such as web and mobile apps.

# Create a Moralis Server

## What is a Moralis Server?

Each dApp is usually divided into 2 parts:

1. **On-chain part:** Smart Contracts, On-Chain Assets like tokens and NFTs, On-Chain transactions etc.
2. **Off-chain part:** Backend infrastructure that collect data from the blockchain, offers an API to clients like web apps and mobile apps, indexes the blockchain, provides real-time alerts, co-ordinates events that are happening on different chains, handles the user life-cycle and so much more.

Moralis Server is used in order to speed up the implementation of the **off-chain part**. Moralis Server is a bundled solution of all the features most dApps need in order to get going as soon as possible.

### Sign up for a free account

Go to [Moralis](https://moralis.io) and sign up for a free account.

### Create a Moralis Server

Click **Create new server** in the top right corner. You can use Moralis to develop dApps for mainnets, testnets and local devchains (for example Hardhat and Ganache).

For now, please select **Mainnet Server**.

Next, select which networks you want your dApp to fetch data from. For the purpose of this demo we select Ethereum, Polygon, BSC and Avalanche.

Now you will see your server in your dashboard, and we can move on and create a web app that talks to the server and is able to login users, fetch user data (tokens, NFTs, historical transactions), and so much more! All cross-chain by default, of course ðŸ¤¯

The server displays several important **indicators** as shown in the image above:

- `Network`: Network traffic per second
- `CPU`: Server's CPU Usage
- `RAM`: Server's RAM Usage
- `DISK`: Server's Disk Usage
- `Number of Users`: The number of users that has been authenticated in the server
