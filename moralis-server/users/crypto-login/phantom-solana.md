# ✨ Phantom (Solana)

If your user has Phantom Wallet installed you can use the following code in order to log them into your Moralis dapp.

`Moralis.authenticate({type: ‘sol’})`

It's important to mention that Solana integration is still in development and Solana users won't get their transactions synced into the database.
