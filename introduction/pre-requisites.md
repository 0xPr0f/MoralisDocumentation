description: The Docs Assume Some JavaScript and Web3 Programming Knowledge.
---

# Prerequisites

Explaining the concepts of JavaScript and Web3 from scratch is beyond the scope of the docs. You don't need to be an expert in Web3 to try Moralis, but some basic knowledge will help you understand it better.

## JavaScript Knowledge

- You have worked with Objects, JSON and MongoDB.
- You've worked with frontend JavaScript and backend JavaScript (for cloud functions).
- Basic knowledge of how to query a database.
  - Moralis queries are constructed with MongoDB query objects.
- Understanding of asynchronous operations.
  - Promises, `async` and `await`.

## Web3 Knowledge

- Understanding of how the blockchain works.
- You have worked with the [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) Library.
- You have used [MetaMask ](https://metamask.io)in your browser. MetaMask is not only a wallet, it allows websites to interact with your wallet, and sign to verify that you are the owner of that wallet.
- You are familiar with smart contracts and smart contract events.
- You have worked with different chains such as mainnet, testnet, or [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) (Ganache is your own local development chain).

## Software

- Text editor with syntax highlighting is highly recommended ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Atom](https://atom.io), etc.).
- Running the demos requires hosting a web page locally.
  - Opening the file will not work as your Moralis server does not know how to communicate with a file. It must be hosted locally on your computer or publicly on a server like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
  - The easiest method is with the "Live Server" extension for Visual Studio Code.
  - You can also use [Python's built-in web server](https://wtmatter.com/python-simple-http-server/).
- The demo code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com). A basic understanding of [git](https://git-scm.com/doc) will be helpful but not necessary.
  - You can find the demos [here](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/demo-apps).
  - The demos use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Ganache, ](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)and [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle).
