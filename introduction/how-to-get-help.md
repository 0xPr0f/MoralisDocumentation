## Human-Based Approach

Why do we invest so heavily into community and developer support?

At the core of our value is Human Based Approach to development. This means that when we build our products we always put you - the developer at the center. We do our best to accelerate your development and save you time. This for example means that we help you when you are stuck or that we ensure our tools are easy to use for building, maintaining, and debugging dapps. 

See this video in order to understand this in-depth.
